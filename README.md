# Toggl Plan Take Home Project

## The Mission

Hello there future Toggl Plan Frontend Developer ðŸ‘‹ Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to add drop functionality to this template:

-   "drag me" element should be draggable between `#drop-area-a` and `#drop-area-b`
-   please add drop shadow to indicate potential new position for the element. Note: drop shadow is an element (not the css property), similar to a drag image. Might be a clone of original dragged element or repositioned original element itself.
-   if dropped outside drop area, drag image should transition back to initial position
-   if dropped onto drop area, drag image should transition to the new position

Note: this template has basic layout and some parts of the interaction figured out for you.
