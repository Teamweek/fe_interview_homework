# Toggl Plan Take Home Project

## The Mission

Hello there future Toggl Plan Frontend Developer 👋 Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to add drop functionality to this template:

- "drag me" element should be draggable between `#drop-area-a` and `#drop-area-b`
- please add drop shadow to indicate potential new position for the element
- if dropped outside drop area, drag image should transition back to initial position
- if dropped onto drop area, drag image should transition to the new position

Note: this template has basic layout and some parts of the interaction figured out for you.

## Getting started on your machine

The first step is to fork this repo so that a fork exists on your own GitHub account. After you have forked the repo, clone your forked version down onto your machine.

Install the repo's dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Then start the local server:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Please remember to commit often so we can see how you're doing 🙌

## Deploy

Once done, publish a minified build of the project to [Surge](http://surge.sh) or [Now](https://zeit.co), and share public URL.

To generate the build:

```
$ npm run build
```

And then upload the generated `dist` folder. For example

```
$ cd dist && surge
```
